# What is Orchestr8?

Orchestr8 is a versatile collection of independent components crafted to simplify task automation, particularly for AI workflows.

It offers a suite of simple, self-documenting components, providing functionalities like code/command execution across host and isolated environments, version control integration, authentication management and schema/definition generation & input validation from types. Each component is independent and incrementally adoptable, so you can use them on their own or in combination with any other library.

These components can also be utilised in AI agent workflows for file system tracking, seamless third-party service authentication, function-calling automation, and code/command/function-call execution in host or isolated environments.

Orchestr8 is open source, free to use, and made with ðŸ§¡ by [synacktra](https://github.com/synacktraa).
